# FUTURE_DS_03
This dashboard analyzes student feedback from college events like Hackathon and TechFest. It shows average ratings, sentiment scores, and participant insights based on department and year, helping organizers understand student experiences better.

Project Overview: College Event Feedback Analysis Dashboard
- This project focuses on analyzing participant feedback collected from college events such as Hackathon and TechFest. Using Power BI, a dynamic dashboard was created to visualize key metrics including:
     - Average Rating of events
     - Feedback and Suggestions Sentiment Scores
     - Department-wise and Year-wise Participation
     - Monthly Feedback Trends
- The dashboard helps event organizers gain actionable insights into student engagement, satisfaction levels, and areas for improvement based on real-time data.

ðŸ”§ Tools used :
1. Google Colab : For data cleaning, sentiment analysis (using Python, Pandas, TextBlob or VADER).
2. Python Libraries
- pandas â€“ for data processing
- textblob or nltk/vaderSentiment â€“ for sentiment analysis
- matplotlib / seaborn â€“ (optional) for preliminary visualization
3. Power BI : For creating interactive dashboards and visualizations.
4. Excel or CSV File : Used as a dataset format (input & output).

ðŸ“Œ Key Insights : 
- Average Rating: 3.33
- Total Feedback Collected: 12.40
- Average Sentiment Score: 0.34
- CS and CSE departments gave the highest average ratings.
- Hackathon had more positive suggestions than TechFest.
- Most participants were from the 1st and 2nd years.

ðŸ“Š Dashboard Insights :
- Bar charts: Show sum of ratings by participant and department.
- Line chart: Shows monthly sentiment trends.
- Pie chart: Distribution of participants by academic year.
- Filters/Slicers: Interactive filtering by department and event.

ðŸ’¡ Skills Gained :
- Data cleaning and preprocessing using Python.
- Sentiment analysis using TextBlob.
- Dashboard creation and DAX in Power BI.
- Business storytelling through visuals.
- Handling filters, slicers, and pie/bar charts for interactivity.

ðŸŽ¯ Purpose of the Project :
- To analyze and visualize feedback from college events, understand student satisfaction through ratings and sentiment, and help organizers improve future event planning based on data-driven decisions.
